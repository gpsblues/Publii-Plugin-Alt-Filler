## Features
This plugin, with no settings required, is designed to (although it hasn't been fully tested yet) populate empty `alt` attributes of images with the file name. It works on: featured images, images, and galleries.

Its functionality is based on regular expressions. Every time an `alt=""` attribute is found, it is filled with the file name, excluding the extension.
