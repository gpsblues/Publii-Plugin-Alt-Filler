## Features
This plugin, with no settings, is intended to (though it hasn't been fully tested yet) populate empty image alt attributes with the file name. It should act on: featured image, images, gallery.

Its functionality is based on regular expressions. Every time an `alt=""` attribute is found, it is populated with the file name, excluding the extension.
