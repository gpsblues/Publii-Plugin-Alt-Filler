# Publii Plugin: `alt` Filler
Fill empty `alt` attributes of `<img>` tags with the corresponding image file name.

<p><img height="100" alt="publii plugin" title="Plugin icons" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gpsblues/Publii-Plugin-Alt-Filler/6b6049e2fe5059afa7fbc9a9bd814b27c53dfd29/.assets/thumbnail.svg"></p>

## Features
This plugin, with no settings required, processes featured images, single images, and galleries across all site pages. File names are adjusted for improved readability with the following enhancements:

- Removal of the file extension.
- Convert to lowercase with the first letter capitalized.
- Replacement of separators (`-`, `_`, `.`) with spaces.
- Addition of a period at the end.
- Removal of the '-thumbnail' suffix for gallery images.

### Example
`<img src="/media/posts/11/gallery/white-CLOUD-in-blue-sky-thumbnail.webp" alt="">`

becomes

`<img src="/media/posts/11/gallery/white-CLOUD-in-blue-sky-thumbnail.webp" alt="White cloud in blue sky.">`

### Note
The plugin uses regular expressions and is designed to work with code generated by Publii. It may not function properly on manually written, pasted, or custom template-derived code. Specifically, keep in mind that:
- The empty `alt=""` attribute must already be present. If missing, it won't be added.
- The empty `alt=""` attribute must follow the `src` attribute (it doesn't need to be immediately following).
- The position of additional attributes, such as `title`, is irrelevant.

The filling of alt attributes is applied only to the HTML output. Publii's backend content remains unchanged.
