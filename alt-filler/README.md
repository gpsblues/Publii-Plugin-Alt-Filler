# Publii Plugin: `alt` Filler 
This plugin automatically populates empty `alt` attributes (`alt=''`) and adds missing `alt` attributes to `<img>` tags, using the corresponding image file name as the value. It ensures your images are more accessible and SEO-friendly.

## Features
This plugin, with no settings required, processes featured images, single images, and galleries across all site pages. File names are adjusted for improved readability with the following enhancements:

- Removal of the file extension: The file extension (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`) is removed to focus on the name.
- Removal of the `-thumbnail` suffix: The `-thumbnail` suffix is removed for gallery images.
- Removal of final numbers: Patterns like `#`, `-#`, `_#`, and `(#)` are removed from the end of file names.
- Replacement of `%20` with spaces: URL-encoded spaces (`%20`) are converted to regular spaces.
- Removal of special characters: Characters like `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `!`, `?`, and `%` are removed.
- Replacement of separators: Characters like `-`, `_`, `.`, and `,` are replaced with spaces.
- Replacement of multiple spaces with a single space**: Extra spaces are reduced to a single space.
- Truncation to 125 characters: File names are truncated to 125 characters to avoid overly long descriptions.
- Capitalization: The first letter is capitalized, and the rest of the text is converted to lowercase.
- Addition of a period: A period `.` is added at the end for proper punctuation.

### Example
`<img src="/media/posts/11/gallery/WHITE-CLOUD-2-in-blue-sky-(02)-thumbnail.webp" alt="">`

`<img src="/media/posts/11/gallery/WHITE-CLOUD-2-in-blue-sky-(02)-thumbnail.webp" alt="White cloud 2 in blue sky.">`

### Note
The plugin uses regular expressions and is designed to work with code generated by Publii. It may not function properly on manually written, pasted, or custom template-derived code. Specifically, keep in mind that:

- Empty `alt=""` attribute: if the `alt` attribute is missing, it will be added automatically. If it is already present but empty (`alt=""`), it will be filled with the processed file name.
- Attribute order: the `alt` attribute does not need to follow the `src` attribute immediately, but the `src` or `srcset` attribute must be present for the plugin to work.
- Additional attributes: the position of other attributes, such as `title`, is irrelevant and does not affect the plugin's functionality.

The filling of `alt` attributes is applied only to the HTML output. Publii's backend content remains unchanged.
